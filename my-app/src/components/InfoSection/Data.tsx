        'Hello! I am a high energy physicist, software developer, and data \
        scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher with the ATLAS \
        collaboration at CERN. My research background includes \
        physics analysis, machine learning, reconstruction software, and detector \
        commissioning. Broadly speaking, I am interested in searches for \
        long-lived particles (LLPs) and the development of the novel \
        reconstruction methods required to search for them. In particular, my \
        research has focused on searches for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to LLPs which \
        decay in the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). With the largest high energy \
        physics dataset ever collected in hand and Run 3 just around the corner, \
        this is an exciting time for LHC physics both in terms of discovery \
        potential as well as opportunity for innovation. I am eager to continue \
        my research program through improving and expanding on analyses using \
        the Run 2 dataset, new ideas for analyses, and preparing for Run 3 and \
        beyond!',
