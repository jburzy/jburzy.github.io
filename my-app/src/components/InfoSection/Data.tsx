    description: 'I am an experimental high energy physicist with a background in physics analysis, reconstruction software, and detector commissioning. Broadly speaking, I am interested in searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) and the development of the novel reconstruction methods required to search for them. In particular, my research has focused on searches for exotic Higgs decays to LLPs which decay in the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). In the future I plan on expanding and improving upon the ongoing search program for Higgs decays to LLPs as well as engaging in Higgs physics more broadly. With the largest high energy physics dataset ever collected in hand and Run 3 just around the corner, this is an exciting time for LHC physics both in terms of discovery potential as well as opportunity for innovation. I am eager to continue my research program through improving and expanding on analyses using the Run 2 dataset, new ideas for analyses, and preparing for Run 3 and beyond. In this statement I will describe my previous and ongoing analysis and detector efforts and outline plans for my future research program.',
